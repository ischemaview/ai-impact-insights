# GitHub Copilot Metrics & Code Production Analysis

## Core Metrics to Track

### 1. Copilot Usage Metrics (from API)
- **Active users**: Number of developers using Copilot
- **Acceptance rate**: % of Copilot suggestions accepted
- **Lines suggested vs accepted**: Volume and quality of suggestions
- **Usage patterns**: Which languages/files see most Copilot activity

### 2. Code Production Metrics (from Git/GitHub)
- **Lines of code per developer per day/week**
- **Commits per developer**
- **PR frequency and size**
- **Code churn rate** (lines added/deleted)

### 3. Correlation Analysis
- **Copilot adoption vs productivity**: Do heavy Copilot users produce more code?
- **Suggestion acceptance vs code quality**: Better acceptance rates = fewer bugs?
- **Team-level impact**: Teams with higher Copilot adoption vs code output

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Collection Setup
1. **GitHub Copilot Metrics API**: Extract usage data
2. **GitHub Repository Analytics**: Get code production metrics
3. **Data correlation**: Match Copilot usage to individual/team productivity

### Phase 2: Analysis Dashboard
- Real-time tracking of Copilot adoption rates
- Code production trends correlated with AI usage
- Individual developer productivity insights
- Team-level impact visualization

### Phase 3: Insights Generation
- Which developers benefit most from Copilot?
- What types of code/tasks show biggest productivity gains?
- ROI calculation: subscription cost vs productivity improvement

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Adoption Impact**: Do teams with higher Copilot usage ship more features?
2. **Individual Variation**: Which developers see the biggest productivity gains?
3. **Code Quality**: Does AI-assisted code maintain quality standards?
4. **Task Effectiveness**: What types of coding tasks benefit most from AI assistance?
