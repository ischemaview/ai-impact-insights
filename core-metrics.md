# AI Tools Impact on Engineering Performance - Core Metrics

## Primary Focus: Time Savings & Efficiency

### 1. Direct Time Savings Metrics

**Coding Speed & Efficiency:**
- **Lines of code per hour** (with vs without AI assistance)
- **Time to first working prototype** 
- **Code completion acceptance rate** (% of AI suggestions accepted)
- **Debugging time reduction** (time to identify and fix bugs)

**Development Workflow:**
- **PR creation to merge time** (review cycle efficiency)
- **Time spent on repetitive tasks** (boilerplate, tests, documentation)
- **Context switching time** (reduced need to look up documentation/examples)

### 2. Quality-Adjusted Productivity

**Code Quality Maintenance:**
- **First-pass code review success rate** (less rework needed)
- **Bug density in AI-assisted vs manual code**
- **Test coverage improvement rate** (AI helping generate tests)

### 3. Learning & Capability Expansion

**Knowledge Acceleration:**
- **Time to learn new technologies/frameworks**
- **Self-sufficiency rate** (less time asking teammates for help)
- **Cross-domain task completion** (able to work outside primary expertise)

### 4. Measurement Approaches

**Direct Measurement:**
- Time tracking: before/after AI tool adoption
- Code analysis: AI-generated vs human-written code performance
- Survey: developer self-reported time savings

**Proxy Measurements:**
- Sprint velocity changes
- Story point completion rates
- Feature delivery frequency

**Qualitative Insights:**
- What tasks do developers spend saved time on?
- Which AI tools provide the most value?
- Where do developers still struggle despite AI assistance?

## Simple Implementation Strategy

### Week 1-2: Baseline
- Track current coding speeds and development times
- Measure typical PR review cycles
- Document time spent on common tasks

### Week 3-6: AI Tool Introduction
- Implement AI coding assistants
- Track the same metrics with AI tools
- Quick daily check-ins on time savings

### Week 7+: Analysis
- Calculate percentage improvements
- Identify highest-impact use cases
- Adjust tool usage based on findings
